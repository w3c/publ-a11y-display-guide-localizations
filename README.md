## Why are there different translations?

An ebook can be purchased in any country without limited
availability or additional delivery costs.
Readers want consistent display of accessibility
information, and that’s the primary role of the display
guide.

The wording proposed in this guide has been widely discussed
by a large group representing different
actors of the English-speaking geographies. It has been
improved after proof-of-concept implementations
and reviewed by panels of testers. 
            
Different countries or different target
audience services may want to use specific language, and we
have provided flexibility in the guide to accommodate this
while maintaining a high level of understanding and similar
quality to help users in a country find likewise information
between two bookstores or libraries in the same language
area.

Simply translating the strings is not enough; the subtle
meaning of the words and phrases of accessibility concepts
must be localized for maximum understanding. Therefore, we
intend to provide a mechanism for the publishing community
to provide translations that localizes the strings for
equally effective communication in many languages.


With the rapidly evolving landscape of accessible ebooks
available, most concerned persons are discovering a new
world. To ensure the information is widely spread and
understood, the implementation by local actors like
libraries serving persons with disabilities and other
local actors in the fight to end the book famine for
readers with print disabilities is crucial and should be
highlighted.

The localization of the display guide is a good
opportunity to make known the rich accessibility
features offered by modern formats like EPUB. In
addition, having a local project scale to write an
understandable vocabulary to describe such features is a
precious qualitative approach that will benefit every
player in the value chain.
